= Ribose RPM Specs

image:https://img.shields.io/travis/riboseinc/rpm-specs/master.svg[Build Status (Travis CI), link=https://travis-ci.org/riboseinc/rpm-specs]

== Introduction

This repo is meant to live as a submodule within individual `rpm-spec-*` repos.

_E.g._,

* https://github.com/riboseinc/rpm-spec-rnp[`rpm-spec-rnp`]

== Building RPMSs

Assuming you have cloned one of the `rpm-spec-*` repos, e.g. `rpm-spec-rnp`:

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/riboseinc/rpm-spec-rnp
cd rpm-spec-rnp
git clone https://github.com/riboseinc/rpm-specs
cd rpm-specs
./docker.sh
----

[source,console]
----
$ ./prepare.sh
----


== Running the container and building manually

Enter the container by not specifying any arguments:

[source,sh]
----
./docker.sh
----

In container:

[source,sh]
----
cd /usr/local/rpm-specs/package
./prepare.sh
----

Then all the RPMs will be available under `/root/rpmbuild/{RPMS,SRPMS}`.


== Automatically building and attempting install

Append the following to your desired `prepare.sh` script:

[source,sh]
----
yum install -y /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/*.rpm
exec bash
----

Then run:

[source,sh]
----
./docker.sh package
----

And you'll be dropped into a `bash` session once building / installing is
complete.
